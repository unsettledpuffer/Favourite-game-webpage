    <h3><u>About</u></h3>
    <p>Project Zomboid is an open-world, isometric video game developed by British and Canadian independent developer The Indie Stone</p>
    <p>Project Zomboid heavily uses windows and drop-down menus for interface navigation</p>
    <p>The game is set in the post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested exclusion zone of the fictional Knox Country (formerly Knox County),
         Kentucky, United States, where the player is challenged to survive for as long as possible before inevitably dying.</p>
    <p>Project Zomboid is set in 1993, with the game starting by default on July 9</p>
    <p>In 2011, The Indie Stone were subject to a high-profile setback within the indie gaming community following the theft of two laptops containing the game's code.
         Since then, Project Zomboid has appeared on Steam Early Access and continues development to this day</p>
    <p>In Project Zomboid, the player aims to survive for as long as possible in an apocalyptic and zombie-ridden area around the city of Muldraugh, Riverside, Echo creek, Rosewood, or West Point Kentucky
          (referred to as 'Knox County) which has been quarantined by the government.[4] The player can choose their character's appearance, occupation, and traits before selecting to spawn within
          one of five starting towns, the occupation that is chosen also will influence where exactly the character will spawn (e.g. a firefighter has a higher chance of spawning in a fire station if 
          the chosen town has one). On top of avoiding zombies, the player has to manage their personal needs (such as hunger, stress, fatigue, and boredom) to stay alive through resting, scavenging 
          for supplies, and using survivalist techniques. The player can level skills through activities and reading skill books and magazines.
         The game uses the traditional Romero style slow-moving zombies, though certain zombies are faster than others, and sandbox mode includes a setting for 28 Days Later-style "sprinter" zombies.</p>

    <p>It is pretty hard to learn as there are so many different things to do, and the most simple mistake can cause your character to lose their life, 
        meaning you then have to restart with a new character.
        When you die there are two options:
        <ul>-Make a new character, on the same world, however your character will have no skills so it will be like restarting except resources are even more scarce than before</ul>
        <ul>-Restart completely</ul>
    <p>It is a game that will punish you heavily for mistakes</p>
